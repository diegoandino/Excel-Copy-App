# Excel App

This is a copy of the Microsoft Excel app that was made with C#'s .NET Framework. It was developed during my CS 3500 Software Practice I class. It features the main Excel features like a table that supports any type of value: Strings, variable assignment, numbers. It also supports any type of mathematical calculation through numbers or variable assignment by finding the correct row and column. Other features include: Saving and loading a file, efficient table calculations, a help menu as well as a way to print your current spreadsheet. 

(All the code was written by me and my partner for the class except for specific code 'skeletons' that a professor wrote in 2013. All of the methods and functionalities of the app were self-made)
